            <h3>The Founding Story: A Legacy of Green Thumbs (Est. 1976)</h3>
            <p>The Medina Herb Society was established in 1976 by a small, dedicated group of local women who recognized the need to preserve traditional herbal knowledge. Meeting originally in private homes, they combined their shared passion for horticulture, folk remedies, and culinary arts. Their primary goal was to create a structured way to pass on this valuable knowledge to the next generation and foster a sense of community among local herb enthusiasts.</p>
            <p>What started as a handful of members trading seeds and tips has grown into a thriving non-profit organization that actively contributes to educational and community projects throughout Medina County.</p>
            
            <h3 style="margin-top: 40px;">Core Activities: Sowing Seeds of Knowledge</h3>

                <h4 style="text-align: left; color: var(--color-accent); border-bottom: none; margin-bottom: 5px;">Education and Workshops</h4>
                <p>Our monthly educational programs are the cornerstone of our society. Topics frequently cover herbal medicine, natural dyeing techniques, essential oil distillation, and traditional culinary applications. We believe in learning by doing, so most meetings feature a hands-on workshop or a guest speaker who is an expert in their field.</p>

                <h4 style="text-align: left; color: var(--color-accent); border-bottom: none; margin-bottom: 5px;">Community Herb Gardens</h4>
                <p>We maintain and cultivate several public herb gardens in the Medina area, serving as both beautiful community assets and outdoor classrooms. These gardens focus on historically relevant, native, and medicinal herbs. Members volunteer their time to plant, maintain, and harvest these plots, offering public tours and demonstrations throughout the growing season.</p>

                <p>A key focus of the Medina Herb Society is documentation. We work to preserve traditional methods of harvesting, drying, and utilizing herbs, ensuring that these valuable skills are not lost in the modern age. This often involves creating members-only handbooks and contributing local findings to regional botanical societies.</p>
